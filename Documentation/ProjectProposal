Description:

Main purpose of my web app is to make it easier for travellers to find perfect tourist spot easily. People can browse through different places of different districts. My web app will going to have two kind of users: Admin and User. Admin will hold the power to control it. User can review every place they have visited. 

Problems: 

People love to visit. But they know only common tourist places. As an example if we talk about Sylhet, we know common beautiful places like Jaflong, Hakaluki Haor, Ratargul Swamp Forest etc. But most of us don’t know that Sylhet has many other beautiful places like Bholagonj, Bichanakandi etc. In that case, most of us don’t even know how beautiful these places are.  

Problem solving:

I’m going to include all these unknown beautiful places in my web app. Through my app they can visit and enjoy these hidden beautiful places. My web app will provide a good simple user interface. And also the system will make it easier for tourists to find their desired places.  
  
Features:

*User can hire a guide using our web app. 

*User can book hotels.

*Every included place will have some photos so that user can choose their desired place.

*User can upload their own captured photos (only nature photo)
