Abstract:

Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accomodating
and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's 
country .The world tourism organisation defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of
tourism as being limited to holiday activity only."

Main purpose of my web app is to make it easier for travellers to find perfect tourist spot easily. People
can browse through different places of different districts of Bangladesh.
